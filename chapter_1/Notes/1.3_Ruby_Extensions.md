## 1.3 Ruby Extensions and Programming Libraries

The extensions that ship with Ruby are usually reffered to as the _standard library_

The standard library includes extensions for a wide variety of projects and tasks:

- Database Manangement
- Networking
- Speciliazed Mathematics
- XML processing
- Many others!

The key to using extensions and libraries is the `require` method, along with its near relation `load`.

These methods allow you to load extensionsa at runtime, including extensions you write yourself.

### 1.3.1 Loading external files and extensions

Ruby facilitates breaking down programs into separate files with `require` and `load` methods.

Exercise `loaddemo.rb`

### 1.3.3 "Require"-Ing a Feature

One major difference between `load` and `require` is that `require`, if called more than once with the same arguments, doesn't reload files it's already loaded.

Ruby keeps track of which files you've required and doesn't duplicate the effort.

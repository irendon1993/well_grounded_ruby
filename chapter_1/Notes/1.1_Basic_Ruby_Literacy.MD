### 1.1.3 The variety of Ruby Identfiers

#### Variables:

- Local
  - Strt with lowercase letter or underscore
  - EX: `first_name`, `string`, `x`
- Instance
  - Store information within individual objects
  - Always start with @ sign: `@age`, `@first_name`
- Class
  - Store information per class hierachy
  - start with 2 @ signs: `@@age`, `@@running_total`
- Global
  - start with $ sign: `$population`
- Constants
- Keywords
- Method Names

#### Constants

Constants begin with an uppecase letter

- Ex: `FirstName` or `FIRST_NAME`

#### Keywords

Predefined, reserved terms associated with specfic programming tasks and contexts

- Keywords include `def`, `class`, `if`, \_\_FILE\_\_

#### Method Names

Names of methods in Ruby follow the same rules and convetions as local variables.

### 1.1.4 Method calls, messages, and Ruby objects

Ruby sees all data structures and values as _objects_

Ever object is capable of understanding a certain set of _messages_.

Each message that an object understands corrsponding directly to a _method_

Message sending is mainly achieved via the special dot operator

- Ex: `"100".to_i`

In this scenario, "100" is the _reciver_ of the message and the method to*i is being \_called*

Methods can take _arguments_ which are also objects.

- Ex: `"100".to_i(9)` which would equal 81

There's always a _self_ defined when your program is running

#### The Origin of Objects in Classes

A _class_ defines an object's functionality, and every object is an _instance_ of exactly one class.

Every time you create a string object, you create an isntance of the class `String`

The ability of objects to adopt behaviors that their class didn't give them is one of the most central defining principles of the design of Ruby as a language

Although every objecy has a class, the class of an object isn't the sole determinant of what the object can do.

#### Reading from a file
